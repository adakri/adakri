### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p align="center">
	<span> Hello there! I am a 21 year old student of computer science & applied mathematics. Currently a third (and final) year student at <a href="https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en/education/mathematical-modeling-vision-graphics-and-simulation#page-presentation">Grenoble-INP ENSIMAG</a>'s Mathematical modeling, vision, graphics and simulation having spent the previous two years at <a href="https://www.bordeaux-inp.fr/en">ENSEIRB-MATMECA</a> where I was specialised in high performance computing and mathematical modeling.
</p>
  
## Why is this here ?
  
<p align="center">
	<span> Well if you are here, you must have arrived through my CV. To keep it brief and to the point, I opted to present in a more expanded manner the project that I had done throughout my academic years. These consist mainly of HPC and GPGPU, computer graphics' as well as computer vision ( and ML) projects, written in a bunch of languages but mainly in C & C++. If you are here by chance, I doubt I would have anything specific to offer but you are more than welcome to gander at what is technically C++ code (but only technically that is)!   
</p>

# <p align="center"><span> :rotating_light: Discalaimer</span>: This is still a work under construction :construction: , I've just started porting some of my older projects from BitBucket and Gitlab and Github changing its token policy is not making it easy.  </p>
